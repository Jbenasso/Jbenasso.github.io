  <h1>Sea Otters</h1>

  <p>
    Sea otters are fascinating marine mammals known for their playful behavior 
    and remarkable intelligence. They are often seen floating on their backs, 
    using rocks as tools to crack open shellfish. These creatures play a vital 
    role in maintaining the balance of kelp forest ecosystems, making them a 
    keystone species. Their presence helps keep sea urchin populations under 
    control, allowing kelp forests to thrive. They're also absolutely adorable!
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond their ecological importance, sea otters are also admired for their 
    unique behaviors and adorable appearance. They have the densest fur of any 
    animal, which protects them from cold ocean waters. Sea otters are highly 
    social, often seen resting in groups called rafts. Fun fact: they hold hands with their partner when they sleep so they don't drift away while resting. Despite facing threats 
    from pollution and hunting in the past, conservation efforts have helped 
    many sea otter populations recover.
